# Battleships

A simple battleship game made using Javascript and HTML.

## Instructions

The object of Battleship is to try and sink all of the other player's before they sink all of your ships. All of the other player's ships are somewhere on his/her board.  You try and hit them by choosing the coordinates of one of the squares on the board.  The other player also tries to hit your ships by choosing the coordinates.  Neither you nor the other player can see the other's board so you must try to guess where they are.  Each clicked squares will indicate a white circle and if a ship was hit then it will instead display a red circle
